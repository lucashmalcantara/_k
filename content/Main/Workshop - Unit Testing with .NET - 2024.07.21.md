## Testing Pyramid

The [[Testing Pyramid]] is a metaphor for thinking about testing in software. [[Mike Cohn]] came up with this concept in his book [[Succeeding with Agile]]. It's a great visual representation that helps us think about different layers of testing. It also tells you how much testing to do on each layer.
